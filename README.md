# TEWTSIM: Tactical Exercise Without Troops Simulator

## Project Overview

TEWTSIM is a web-based application developed to support Canadian Armed Forces training initiatives, with a focus on providing a platform for tactical decision-making at the Infantry School in a low-stakes environment. This tool digitizes Tactical Decision Games (TDGs), offering an interactive platform for CAF personnel to sharpen their critical thinking skills in simulated combat scenarios.
