# TEWTSIM: Tactical Exercise Without Troops Simulator

## Project Overview

TEWTSIM is a web-based application developed to support Canadian Armed Forces training initiatives, with a focus on providing a platform for tactical decision-making at the Infantry School in a low-stakes environment. This tool digitizes Tactical Decision Games (TDGs), offering an interactive platform for CAF personnel to sharpen their critical thinking skills in simulated combat scenarios.

üéñÔ∏è **Developed under the guidance of WO Outar, Platoon Warrant of Officer Preparation Platoon, Infantry School**

üöÄ **Current Status:** MERN Stack Implementation

üîê **Classification:** UNCLASSIFIED

## Training Benefits

TEWTSIM aims to enhance:

1. Critical thinking in tactical scenarios
2. Decision-making under pressure
3. Strategic approach exploration
4. Preparation for field exercises
5. Tactical textual scenario data collection for organizational analysis and future development

## Installation Guide (Local Development Environment)

1. Clone the TEWTSIM repository
   `git clone https://github.com/M-o-liver/tewtsim-mern`
   `cd tewtsim-mern`

2. Install dependencies
   `npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..`

3. Set up environment variables
   - Create a .env file in the root directory
   - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET)

4. Start the development server
   npm run dev

5. Access the application
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

Note: Ensure you have Node.js, npm, and MongoDB installed on your system before proceeding with the installation.

## Scenario Management

TEWTSIM scenarios are now managed through MongoDB. To add a new scenario:

1. Develop the Tactical Decision Game (TDG) content as before

2. Use the provided API endpoints to create new missions

   - POST /api/missions to create a new mission
   - Include all necessary mission data in the request body

3. Test the new scenario

   - Access the new scenario through the frontend interface
   - Verify all content displays correctly
   - Ensure the mission flow functions as intended

Best Practices:

- Maintain consistency in data structure across scenarios
- Regularly backup the database
- Consider version control for scenario content to track changes over time
